This was my startup project in 2013, it worked quite well and had some users.
It was created based in coaching, as I was part of Toastmasters International and we used it to train ourselves and give feedback.

At that moment was a commercial project but it did not give the results I wanted.

From now on, all the code that was done by me and does not have any other dependency is under the MIT license.

The UI is mostly based in proprietary code in the UI that I bought and modified, that code is not to be reused or sold unless you own the respective license.
